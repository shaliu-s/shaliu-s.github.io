Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. student at Computer Network Information Center, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by [Prof. Jun Li](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~leejun). My current research focuses on hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs), with the goal of making them safer, more reliable, and ultimately more trustworthy for real-world applications.
